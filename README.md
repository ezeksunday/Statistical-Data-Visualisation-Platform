## APP USAGE  
The app is an offline and online Data visualisation platform which allows one to visualise data online and offline.  
The app contains various plot types ranging from 2-dimensional plots to 3 dimensional plots. 
The platform allows you to select a plot type from the menu bars and then click on the plot button to visualise the selected plot.  

HOW TO USE A PLOT  
1- select a file or enter url of file to be downloaded using the search bar above. To select a file from your local machine,
    Choose on the open file button either from the menu by the left panel or using the file menu to select upload file  
2- For 2 dimensional plots, select x and y column pending on the plot type. You can choose a hue column which is optional  
3- For 3 dimensional plots, select x,y and z depending on the selected 3d plot type. NOTE- For 3-d plots, all selected values must be numerical  
4- To see files you've recently worked with, click on the recent files button to see all the files you have previously opened and worked with.  

HOW TO VIEW STATISTICAL DETAILS OF A SELECTED DATASET  
To view the statistical details of a selected dataset, from the menu bar, choose the desired statistical measure. This measures are displayed under the statistical details 
menu by the left which is together with the attributes details which provides information about the columns present in the selected dataset.  

HOW TO PERFORM PREPROCESSING OF DATA  
To perform preprocessing, select a preprocessing tool from the pre process data menu. After selection input values (where required) and click on ok. Preprocessed step will be displayed in the table presented below graph display

AIMS  
As many visualization platforms are been developed, some of these platforms are expensive to work with and has limited support in terms of providing users with much needed freedom when conducting analysis. The paper aims at developing an easy to use data visualization platform that supports data exploration, preprocessing, and visualization both in 2-Dimensional and 3-Dimensional views for any imported dataset and also provide users with much needed flexibility when working with data. 

OBJECTIVES  
Development of an interface that is time and cost efficient 
Development of a platform that supports both online and offline data visualization. 
Development of an interface that supports data in different formats. 
Development of an interface that provides flexibility to users in terms of pre processing data and interacting with data 
Development of an interface that supports data visualization (both 2-d and 3-d dimensions)

LIMITATIONS OF EXISTING WORKS
1. Limited flexibility in terms of providing users with adequate interaction with data
2. Most platforms are Cost-bound
3. Some are online based (SAP Lumira, Microsoft power BI, Tableau)

PROGRAMMING TOOLS  USED  
Programming language – Python programming (Object oriented programming)  
Libraries:  
Tkinter – For GUI interface development  
. Numpy – For data manipulation  
. Pandas – For file (datasets) handling and manipulation  
. Matplotlib – For development of visualization techniques  
. Seaborn – For development of visualization techniques (Mostly 2-d views)  
. customtkinter – Used alongside tkinter module for beatified interface  
. ttkthemes – To add more beauty to the interface
